# Network & Connectivity Knowledge Base

This wiki was created for the purpose for open-souce access to the technical basics of networking and connectivity.The content explores key networking principles, such as networking basics, network protocols like IP, TCP & UDP, DNS & DHCP, and HTTP/HTTPS, as well as Network Address Translation (NAT). It also delves into wired and wireless technologies, including Ethernet standards, Wi-Fi (802.11 standards), Bluetooth, and BLE.

Additionally, the knowledge base covers **internal routing mechanisms** like OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) and MAC addresses, along with **external routing topics**, such as BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) and Autonomous Systems.

The knowledge base is available in the [Wiki](https://github.com/O-LavenderAshburn/Knowledgebase_NetworkAndConnectivity/wiki)
