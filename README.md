# Network & Connectivity Knowledge Base

The **Network & Connectivity Knowledge Base** serves as a comprehensive resource covering networking concepts, technologies, and best practices. It includes both fundamental and advanced topics related to networking, communication protocols, and infrastructure. 

The content explores key networking principles, such as **networking basics**, **network protocols** like IP, TCP & UDP, DNS & DHCP, and HTTP/HTTPS, as well as **Network Address Translation (NAT)**. It also delves into **wired and wireless technologies**, including Ethernet standards, Wi-Fi (802.11 standards), Bluetooth, and BLE. 

Additionally, the knowledge base covers **internal routing mechanisms** like OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) and MAC addresses, along with **external routing topics**, such as BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) and Autonomous Systems.

The knowledge base is available in the [Wiki](https://github.com/O-LavenderAshburn/Knowledgebase_NetworkAndConnectivity/wiki)
